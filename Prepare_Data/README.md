# üõ†Ô∏è Preparing AC/DC Grid Data

The data required for AC/DC OPF includes are listed and shown blow, and all data are stored in .csv format
due to its compatibility with various coding language environments. Matpower provides various AC grid case files.

Sometimes, we may want
to directly select and integrate multiple AC grids without manually modifying data files. To facilitate this
process, we provide auxiliary functions.
